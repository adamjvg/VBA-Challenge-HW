Homework for VBA Challenge

This repo contains my VBA code to run on the stock market files, as well as screen shots of all 3 years of data. 
I am aware that the 2016 screenshot does not have a 'greatest percentage increase' ticker code. I have deliberately left this as I cannot work out where the bug is. 2014 and 2015 work perfectly and provide answers using VBA code to populate cells.
